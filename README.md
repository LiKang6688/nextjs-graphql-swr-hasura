# nextjs-graphql-swr-hasura

## The Idea

This is a demo app demonstrating usage of `SWR` or `React Query` library with a Hasura GraphQL API. The app uses native websockets or Subscriptions Transport Ws for implementing GraphQL subscriptions on the client.

- Hasura GraphQL APIs for instant GraphQL backend.
- Integrate GraphQL queries.
- Integrate GraphQL mutations.
- GraphQL Subscriptions using native websockets or Subscriptions Transport Ws.
